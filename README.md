# DNA Sequence Binding Classifier ðŸ§¬

This project provides a deep learning solution for classifying DNA sequences based on their binding properties. 
It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and unsupervised clustering techniques to improve predictive performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

The project expects the following dataset files in the `data/` folder:

- `Xtr.csv` : Training DNA sequences.
- `Ytr.csv` : Binary labels (0 or 1) for training sequences.
- `Xte.csv` : Test DNA sequences to be predicted.
- `Xtr_mat100.csv` : Optional precomputed feature matrix for training (2000 x 100).
- `Xte_mat100.csv` : Optional precomputed feature matrix for test (1000 x 100).

> All DNA sequences are 101 characters long, composed of the nucleotides `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

Two neural models are trained:

- `CNNOnly`: A convolutional network trained on one-hot encoded DNA sequences.
- `CNNKMeansFusion`: A dual-input model that combines sequence data with clustering-based features from KMeans.

Final predictions are generated by averaging the outputs from both models (weighted ensemble).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrishounwnu/dna-sequence-binding-classifier.git
